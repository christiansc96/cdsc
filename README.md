This api is built with ORM Entity Framework Core using Code First Migrations. Steps to create the database:

To create the database you just have to replace the string connection found in the appsettings.json file and put the one you will use.
The next step is to open the package manager console.
Then, under Default Project, choose the TicketManagerAPI.Database project.
Finally run the Update-Database command and this will create the database that is the data model.
